## Internal Communication

### Communication Tools

- **Slack**: Primary tool for day-to-day communication, team collaboration, and updates.
- **Zoom/Google Meet**: For meetings, video calls, and remote collaboration.
- **Email**: For formal communication, such as official announcements, reports, and client interactions.

### Responsibilities

- **Project Managers** are responsible for sending the **minutes of meetings (MOM)** or **daily task updates** to the project Slack channel. These updates should be shared every day to keep everyone in the loop, from developers to leadership. This ensures that the entire team is aware of progress, blockers, and priorities.
- **Developers** are responsible for tracking their time and updating their tasks on **Jira** and reporting their progress in the project Slack channel on a daily basis without fail.

## External Communication (Client Communication)

### Communication Tools

- **Client’s Preferred Tool**: If the client uses a specific tool, that should be used (e.g., Microsoft Teams, etc.). Otherwise, continue using **Slack** and **Email** for communication.
- **Zoom/Google Meet**: Used for scheduled client calls and important meetings.

### Meetings

- Client meetings should be scheduled **at the end of each sprint** (1-2 weeks). These meetings are essential to discuss progress, gather feedback, and align on next steps.
- **Important Calls**: All important calls with clients should be recorded, and the **Project Manager** is responsible for sending out the **MOM** (Minutes of Meeting) to the client after the call.
- **Who Should Attend**: Typically, the **Project Manager**, **Technical Lead**, and sometimes a **Senior Developer** should attend these calls, depending on the topics discussed.

## Reporting

### Time Tracking

- Every team member should track their time daily in **Jira**. We use **Clockify** for time tracking, which integrates seamlessly with **Jira** to help log work hours for each task. This integration ensures that time tracking is accurate and easily monitored.
- Developers should report their work updates daily in the project’s **Slack channel**, ensuring transparency in work progress.

### Sprint Reporting

- **Project Managers** are responsible for sending **Sprint Updates** to the **Leadership Team** and **Client** at the end of each sprint. These updates should include:
  - Work completed during the sprint
  - Key achievements
  - Any blockers or challenges faced
  - A plan for the next sprint
  - Feedback from clients, if any, should also be included.

### Steps if Reporting Process Is Not Followed

- If team members fail to track time daily or fail to report updates in the Slack channel, the **Project Manager** should give a reminder and escalate the issue if it continues. Repeated failures will be addressed in performance reviews.
- If **Project Managers** fail to send the sprint updates or MOMs after client calls, it will be escalated to leadership, and corrective actions will be taken.

## Feedback Mechanisms

- Internal feedback will be collected during sprint reviews, 1:1s, and retrospectives.
- Client feedback should be gathered at the end of every sprint to evaluate progress, satisfaction, and any areas for improvement.
- The **Project Manager** should ensure that feedback from clients is documented, addressed, and shared with the team.

## Documentation

- All progress should be documented in tools like **Jira** for task management and **GitHub/Bitbucket** for version control.
- At the end of each sprint, **Project Managers** should generate and send a detailed sprint report to both the **Leadership Team** and the **Client**, including:
  - Sprint accomplishments
  - Upcoming tasks
  - Client feedback
  - Project risks or concerns
- **Project Managers** are also responsible for ensuring that **MOMs** are sent after all important meetings and client calls.
