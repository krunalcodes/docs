**Cross-Functional Teams:**

- **Collaboration Across Functions**: We work with cross-functional teams where developers, designers, and other specialists collaborate to achieve project goals. In some cases, we also hire developers from external companies for temporary assignments. These external members are expected to use our internal tools (like Slack) unless the client prefers another communication tool.
- **Client-Specific Tools**: If a client recommends a different communication tool, we adapt accordingly to ensure smooth collaboration. However, for internal collaboration, our default tools are Slack and Jira.

**Collaboration Process:**

- **Daily Standups**: Every team member participates in daily standups to discuss their tasks, progress, and any blockers. This keeps the entire team aligned and aware of each other's work.
- **Sprint Planning**: We hold sprint planning meetings to define the scope, goals, and priorities for the upcoming sprint. This is done at the start of every sprint to ensure all team members are aligned with the deliverables.
- **Sprint Reviews**: At the end of each sprint, we conduct sprint reviews to assess what has been accomplished, what issues arose, and how we can improve in future sprints. Feedback is gathered from all members to enhance the process.

**Tools for Collaboration:**

- **Slack**: Slack is the primary tool for communication within teams. It facilitates real-time discussions and helps keep track of important messages through dedicated channels.
- **Jira**: Jira is used for tracking progress, managing tasks, and monitoring sprint goals. It allows teams to stay organized and ensures visibility across all tasks.
